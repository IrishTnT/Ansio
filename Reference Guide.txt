    Reference
      Guide
-----------------
Welcome to the entire lore sheet for the 'Ansio' ConWorld.
Here is a quick guide on how to reference portions of the
World:
1. Reference IDs are ADDITIONAL. For example:
	If you want to look at the History of the Eclipse Empire, you would go to:
	3. - Places and Shit
	2. - States
	4. - Eclipse Empire
	4. - History
	That would be written as: '3244' or 'REF3244'

	If you wanted to view a the Deity Template for Children, you would go to:
	4. - Lore
	1. - Panteon
	2. - Deity List
	1. - Present
	0. - Template
	1. - Children
	That would be: '412101' or 'REF412101'
2. When referencing or trying to access references, the numbers each represent the FILE NUMBER. This resets every time you click on a file. So if you were to enter file 4. in the first list. You are now in 4. and the numbering system resets.
3. Lore also serves as Misc.
